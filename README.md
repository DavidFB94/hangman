## Overview
Hangman is a terminal based game that let the user test their word knowledge.

The user will compete against the computer to guess a randomly chosen word, one letter at a time. The amount of guesses are limited, so use the them with caution!

The user can choose between different word categories, and based on the word length, the amount of guesses will be set. 

This game was built as a project for the Diploma in Full Stack Software Development at Code Institute.

### Mock-up

## UX

I started out with a flowchart to determine the mapping of the app. After that I followed a tutorial to create the base structure, and adjusted the code to align with the ideas I had for the game.

Once the game was created, I wanted to add some color to the text, to make it a bit more interesting/easy to look at. I imported Colorama, and added the styling to the code.
