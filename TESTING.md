## Code Validation

### Python

I have used the recommended [PEP8 CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) to validate all of my Python files.

| File | CI URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| hangman.py | [PEP8 CI](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DavidFB94/hangman/main/hangman.py) | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/py-validation-hangman.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| words.py | [PEP8 CI](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DavidFB94/hangman/main/words.py) | ![screenshot](documentation/py-validation-words.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| food.py | [PEP8 CI](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DavidFB94/hangman/main/food.py) | ![screenshot](documentation/py-validation-food.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| animals.py | [PEP8 CI](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DavidFB94/hangman/main/animals.py) | ![screenshot](documentation/py-validation-animals.png) | Pass: No Errors |

## Browser Compatibility

I've tested my deployed project on multiple browsers to check for compatibility issues.
